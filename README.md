1. Content Filtering:
In this algorithm, we try finding items look alike. Once we have item look like matrix,we can easily recommend alike items to a customer, who has purchased any item from the store.

2. Collaborative Filtering:
Here, we try to search for look alike customers and offer products based on what his/her lookalike has chosen.This algorithm is very effective but takes a lot of time and resources.

3. Hybrid Filtering (Content Filtering + Collaborative Filtering):
Both Content Filtering & Collaborative Filtering is used for the purpose. you-tube uses this algorithm for their strong recommendation system.
